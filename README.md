Why BabyRedis?
- [Fuck Redis!](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40030746) ... [This is SQLite](https://kerkour.com/sqlite-for-servers) but all the good things about redis :}

Bad things :{
    - still a little lower than in memory Redis

Good things :}
    - faster than disk base SQLite 

Hope this works.
